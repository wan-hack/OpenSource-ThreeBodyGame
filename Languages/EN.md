# Open Source Three-Body Game - First-Person Experience

## 🌟 Project Introduction
This is a **non-commercial, permanently free open-source game** initiated by a 6th-grade Three-Body fan, built together with global Three-Body fans.
We 1:1 recreate the Three-Body Game that Wang Miao played in the original novel, with a first-person perspective to experience the survival challenges of the Stable Era/Chaotic Era, restoring classic mechanics such as Dehydration/Rehydration, Three Suns in the Sky, and Flying Star warnings.

## 🎮 Core First-Person Gameplay
1.  **View**: First-person (you are the player in the game), in a simple village on the Three-Body Planet.
2.  **Era Rule**: Randomly start in Stable Era/Chaotic Era. A 5s red text prompt ("Chaotic Era is coming! Extreme heat, dehydrate quickly!") will appear before Chaotic Era.
3.  **Dehydration & Rehydration**:
    - Stable Era: Click yourself to rehydrate (resume activity) and collect water/ore resources.
    - Chaotic Era: Click yourself to dehydrate (become dry fiber, immune to heat), and rehydrate again after Stable Era resumes.
4.  **Win Condition**: Collect 3 mixed resources, go to the village observatory to unlock era prediction, and achieve "civilization survival".

## 🤝 Global Recruitment for Co-builders
All positions are **zero threshold**, whether you are a Three-Body fan, player, programmer, artist, or translator:
- **Technical**: Code development, art design, multi-language adaptation
- **Fan**: Organize original settings, design plots, community translation
- **Player**: Test the game, report bugs, provide experience suggestions

## 📜 Project Rules
1.  Adopt **GPLv3 open source protocol**, permanently free, anyone can modify and share.
2.  All gameplay/settings must be consistent with the original *The Three-Body Problem*, the project leader has the final decision right.
3.  Non-commercial, no in-app purchases, no salaries, purely interest-driven.
